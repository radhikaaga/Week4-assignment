üîó [HackerRank Problem Link](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/full-score/problem)

### üìù Problem Statement

Julia just finished hosting a coding contest.  
You need to generate a leaderboard showing the **hacker ID** and **name** of all hackers who achieved **full scores in more than one challenge**.

- A **full score** is earned when a hacker‚Äôs submission score equals the **maximum score** for that challenge‚Äôs difficulty.
- Display only those hackers who achieved full scores in **more than one challenge**.
- Order the results by:
  1. Number of full-score challenges (descending),
  2. Hacker ID (ascending) in case of ties.
